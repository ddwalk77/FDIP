## Introduction
Fire departments are not only composed of fire fighters that fight fire, but EMT,
paramedic, and rescue. They respond to a variety of calls through 911 dispatch-
ing. They respond with the police department when needed, to vehicle accidents,
medical calls as the paramedics operate through the same facility or are also fire
fighters, and various rescue operations due to water, machinery, or chemical in-
cidents to name a few. Incidents can vary in number of people needed, the type
of services required, and equipment needed. Because of the diversity in services
that are needed from fire departments due to incident and location types, and
additionally requiring the fastest response time, resources must be readily avail-
able. Resources include human resources and equipment. All incidents are logged
through the National Fire Incident Reporting System by each fire company and
some larger municipalities have made this information readily available through
their city website.

- ### Goals of this Research
The goal of this research is to use municipality incident history to predict future
incident locations, location type, incident type, and required resources. This
information can be useful to departments for resource allocation allowing for
proper staffing, equipment availability, and potential training opportunities. Uti-
lizing the historical incident locations we should be able to make some predictions
on future incident locations. This information can be used to strategically place
staff. Knowing the type of location of the incident, high-rise apartment, single
family home, manufacturing facility, etc., and the type of incident, allows for
further resource planning of equipment allocation and further staffing require-
ments. An evaluation of response time and staffing could also lead to a realization
of potential training opportunities or specialty resources that potentially would
add value.

## Methodology

- ### Data Collection
Data has been obtained through the City of New York open data site [1]. As
of the time of writing this, the data was last updated April 8, 2022 with the
initial creation on July 27, 2016 and is noted as updating annually. It includes all
incidents handled through the fire companies including fire, medical and non-fire
emergencies. It contains twenty-four columns and 4.16 million rows. The data is
available for download and has an API available. This dataset contains the type
of incident, the date and time of the incident, incident duration, actions taken,
location information, resources utilized, and fire details if a fire was present.
